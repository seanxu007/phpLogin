1.I tried to avoid following attacks:
SQL Injections
Session Hijacking
Network Eavesdropping
Cross Site Scripting
Brute Force Attacks

2.Index.php is the default page, which link to login, logout and register.

3.Most of the function is inside include folder, the module inside include folder contains all the library: hybridauth-master and PHPMailer-master.

4.Js folder contain javascript which used for form validation and hash.

5.REST Service function is inside restAPI folder, authentication.php get email and password and send back token, getuser.php get token and send back user list.
